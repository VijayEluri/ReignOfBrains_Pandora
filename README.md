Reign of Brains is a simple 2D Zombie shooter. It's style is similar to the TMNT arcade games. Thus far, there is one complete level, where the player can enter various doors to collect items. Items help the player survive the level and include sandwiches, health packs and ammunition. This game runs on Windows, Mac and Linux. The target platform for this game is the Pandora hand-held gaming computer. Once the device ships, I plan on spending some time optimizing the code to run really smoothly on this platform.

This game was originally written for a Game Development course at Tufts University, where I occasionally audit classes. The first version of the game was developed by Sarah Keefe, Peter Millar and myself. In the first version, Sarah and I wrote all the code, Peter provided the background art, music and sound effects, and I did all of the character art. I have continued developing the game on my own and have greatly extended the functionality and gameplay. I have also open-sourced it by uploading all of the source code and original art to github. I plan on continuing to develop this game, by doing as much optimization as possible, and then adding more levels and fixing the sound on Linux. Development on this game ended in late December of 2010.
